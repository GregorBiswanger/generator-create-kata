# `create-kata` generator for yeoman

## Introduction
This yeoman generator will create a simple typescript project with support for running tests with jest.

## Usage

1. Create a folder for your kata project
2. Enter that folder (`cd your-folder`)
3. Call `yo create-kata` and answer the prompted questions

The most important piece of information you will be asked for, is the kata's name.
It will be used to build:

* the project's name in the `package.json`
* a spec file for your tests
* a class for your solution code
